# vainbot v1.0
A "late night" build of an Instagram bot, providing information about user's account (followers, likes etc.). Implemented in python.

- Run:
  - pip install selenium.
  - configure chrome and webdriver. 
  - "$ python3 unfollowers.py" from any parent dir.
  
- Bare in mind:
  - If using your real Instagram account deactivate the "Two Layer Authentication Protocol" before using, else bot is not about to work.
  
- Contributions:

  - Project is about to be updated whenever there is spare time for me to work on it. Therefore feel free to contribute..
